# The project includes four pages: welcome, survey one, survey two, and thank you. Its purpose is to collect additional information specifically from college students.

# The web form was created using best practices, including HTML and CSS to make it visually appealing and effective. To ensure proper formatting, the HTML code was checked with a validator, and all four pages passed the validation process.

# Accessibility features were also incorporated into the web form, and the website passed WCAG 2.1, level AA. Adhering to these standards is crucial to ensure the website can be used by people with disabilities.

# In class, the importance of inclusion in website creation was discussed. While the form's options were chosen carefully, they may not be exhaustive. In the future, all recommended options from experts would be included. Additionally, as a best practice, unnecessary information is not included.

# Overall, this project provided valuable experience in creating an inclusive web form that can be customized with HTML and CSS.
